## Machine Learning & Image Classification

### PCOS Classification

Study on classifying Polycystic Ovary Syndrome using clinical and lifestyle data (parameters like AMH, BMI, beta-HCG, age). The ML pipeline covers data preprocessing and a comparison of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.

`numpy` · `pandas` · `sklearn`


### Vine Disease Recognition — Bachelor's Thesis

**"Recunoașterea bolilor specifice viței de vie prin analiza de imagini"**

Diploma project focused on identifying grapevine diseases from images. Covers model training with data augmentation and evaluation using classification reports and confusion matrices.

`Python` · `Keras` · `VGG16`


## Recommendation Systems

### Scientific Articles Recommender

Recommends scientific articles using Collaborative Topic Regression on the CiteULike-t dataset (7,947 users · 25,975 items).


### Movie Recommendation System

A web app that recommends movies based on user preferences. Uses Matrix Factorization for the core model and cosine similarity for ranking. Includes a TMDB image scraper for movie posters and a simple user authentication setup.

`Python` · `Flask` · `PyTorch` · `MovieLens ml-latest-small`


## Database Projects

### Online Store — Electronics Products Management

Relational database for managing an electronics store. Includes an Entity-Relationship diagram, relational model, and the full MySQL schema.


### Publishing House Management

Earlier database project covering the data model and management logic for a publishing house.


## Electrotechnics


### Contactless Card Access System
